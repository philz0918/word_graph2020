# word_graph2020

Diachronic changes of language include changes in all aspects of language, in which changes in lexical meaning are comparatively fast than other aspects, such like phonological variations and syntactic structures. Lexical meaning evolution always endures a complicate path, therefore in this project. Based on the data we have collected, that is, 400 English literature books between 19th and 20th century (200 for each century) and check how the word meanings change through time in two perspectives.

1. Train word embeddings with lemmatized words and create networks for each time period with word embeddings, then check the target words by doing network analysis. Target words, such like 'awful', 'pretty', etc. (We would collect words from lexical semantics papers)

2. Train word embeddings with word_pos, and create networks, check the role that part-of-speech plays in word meaning evolution.
